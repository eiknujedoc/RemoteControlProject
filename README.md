## Remote Control Project

### Week 1 Homework for Skill Distillery

#### Overview

* This is a remote control simulation.

This program simulates a remote control by requiring the user to power the virtual device [ON] before any other functionality is enabled.
Once the virtual device has been powered on, the buttons become enabled and return "BOOP" when pressed until the virtual device is powered [OFF]

#### Concepts

* Loops

do-while Loops
The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, except the condition is placed after the loop body.

do {
  loop body
} while (condition);

The condition is checked at the end of each execution of the loop body; it determines if the loop body should execute again.
* This means that a do-while loop body will always execute at least once.

Notable do-while differences:
* do-while must have a semicolon at the end.
* do-while will execute at least once.

int num = 999;
do {
  System.out.println("num is " + num); //will execute even though num is not 0
} while (num == 0);

* Variable scope
* Switch


#### Technologies Used

* Java
* While loops
* Eclipse IDE
* Atom
* Shell
